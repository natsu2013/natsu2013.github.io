![About](/assets/img/headers/awscommunitybuilder.webp)

I'm Deniz, `AWS Community Builder` and `AWS Content Creator` from London.

At Cloud Academy, my role involves designing, developing, and revising the production process and implementation of AWS content. My work spans a variety of AWS technologies, aiming to help student grasp how to effectively implement and configure AWS services.

Outside of work, I am passionate about building on AWS. I spend my time experimenting with different cloud services, integrating them to create fun and practical solutions. I document these solutions on this site and also share them through my YouTube channel: [Hands-On with Digital Den](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHoxUz0IfdhOieSXox_mwSw)

This documenation site is built using Jekyll, a static site generator with the Chirpy theme. The site is configured with GitHub Actions for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages whenever I push changes. A custom domain is established via a CNAME record pointing to `docs.digitalden.cloud`, making the site live and accessible on GitHub Pages. It's all open source, and you can view it here on [GitHub](https://github.com/digitalden3/digitalden3.github.io).
