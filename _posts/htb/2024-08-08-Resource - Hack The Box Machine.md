_Resource HTB Season VI_

Hello, everyone! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome back. This is the first machine challenge of `Season VI` and it has a medium difficulty level. As with many previous attempts to pwn a box, I will use the `nmap` tool to scan the target machine and determine which ports are open.

```bash
[user@machine] - $ nmap -p- 10.10.11.x -T4 --min-rate=1000 -Pn --disable-arp-ping -oN nmapscan
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-08-04 10:59 EDT
Warning: 10.10.11.x giving up on port because retransmission cap hit (6).

```

With the initial scan, I determined that three ports are open on the target machine: 22, 80, and 2222.

```bash
[user@machine] - $ nmap -p22,80,2222 -sC -sV 10.10.11.x

{: .nolineno }

From the nmap scan report, we can see that the target machine has the following open ports and services:
- Ports open:
    - 22/tcp: SSH service (OpenSSH 9.2p1 Debian)
    - 80/tcp: HTTP service, redirect to `http://itrc.ssg.htb/` and has an `nginx/1.18.0` server header.
    - 2222/tcp: SSH service (OpenSSH 8.9p1 on Ubuntu)

I am wondering why there are two SSH services open on different ports for two different versions of OpenSSH?<br>
Use this command to add an IP and hostname to file `/ect/hosts`

```bash
[user@machine] - $ echo "10.10.11.x itrc.ssg.htb" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

Next, I accessed the target machine on port 80 at `http://itrc.ssg.htb`, which led me to an IT Support Center page. Reading the introduction section on the website, it mentions `Managing SSH Access`, ...

Next, to see what this website does, I need to register an account and log in.

Use ffuf to `fuzz` the `page` parameter.

Accessing the `page=admin`, I see several tickets with subjects such as `Malware in finance dept` and `SSH Key Signing Broken`, but I cannot access most of these tickets to view their detailed contents.

And one notable thing is that under Admin Tools, I see `Contact zzinter for manual provisioning`

Going back to the dashboard, I tried to create a ticket with the subject `New ticket` and uploaded a ZIP file.
![](/assets/img/posts/htb/VT7KF8aPSu.png){: width="972" height="589" }

When I right-clicked on the `file.zip` location, I saw that the uploaded file is stored at the path: `itrc.ssg.htb/uploads/a00308c0438df0f0cb98f5261ca9124e57fcd1ed.zip`
![](/assets/img/posts/htb/f4fL4Yfuzg.png){: width="972" height="589" }

Looking at the filename, it appears to be some sort of hash, and it is indeed a SHA-1 hash.

_sha1sum file.zip_

After uploading a regular ZIP file, I tried uploading an empty file to see if any errors occurred.
In the response, I noticed that two functions mentioned in the misreporting are `ZipArchive::open()` and `hash_file()` in the file `/var/www/savefile.inc.php`

## msainristil@itrc

As mentioned earlier in the admin page, we saw several tickets that had already been created, and upon checking the uploads directory, I found multiple ZIP files. It's possible that, besides the files I uploaded, the remaining files were uploaded by those tickets.

I used zipgrep to check if any of these ZIP files contain sensitive information.

```bash
$ for zipfile in *.zip; do zipgrep "msainristil" "$zipfile"; done

"user=msainristil&pass=82yards2closeit"
